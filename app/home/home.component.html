      <h2>Solar Solutions</h2>
      <p>Providing state-of-the-art solar panels and renewable energy solutions.
        Solar power works by converting energy from the sun into power. There are two forms of energy generated from the sun for our use – electricity and heat.

Both are generated through the use of solar panels, which range in size from residential rooftops to ‘solar farms’ stretching over acres of rural land.

      <h2>Fire Safety</h2>
      <p>Comprehensive fire safety systems and equipment for all environments.</p>
      <p>Fire Protection Systems
        Fire protection systems are designed to detect fires, alert occupants, and control or extinguish fires. Key components include:
        
        Smoke Detectors and Fire Alarms: These devices detect smoke and fire, alerting occupants to the danger. They are essential for early detection, giving people more time to evacuate.
        
        Sprinkler Systems: Fire sprinklers automatically release water when a fire is detected, helping to control or extinguish it before it spreads. These systems are especially effective in commercial buildings and large residential complexes.
        
        Fire Extinguishers: Portable fire extinguishers are a first line of defense against small fires. They are classified by the types of fires they can extinguish (e.g., Class A for ordinary combustibles, Class B for flammable liquids, and Class C for electrical fires).
        
        Fire Doors and Fire-Resistant Materials: These are designed to prevent the spread of fire and smoke, giving occupants more time to evacuate and minimizing damage.</p>
